Hello,
My name is Saliha. I am a student at HYF.
I used to not like coding but my perception of it is now changing. I used to hate math too but when I got the hang of it became my fav. Who knows how coding will turn out!
I am a cat & tea person. My favourite color is blue yet I often seek yellow and white.  
I hope that other cognitive aliens apart from humans exist.
